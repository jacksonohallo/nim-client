Nathan S. Santos Portfolio

Thanks to [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7) for the excellent website design reference. Although this project design was highly inspired by [https://brittanychiang.com/](https://brittanychiang.com/), this is not a fork, all the code was written by [me](https://github.com/nathanssantos).
